# 🧭 Executive Portfolio – Web Application for a Strategy Consultant

This repository contains the codebase for a professional portfolio web application developed for a corporate strategy manager.  
The goal of this project is to provide a sleek, responsive, and structured platform to highlight the manager's expertise, thought leadership, and strategic achievements.

## 📌 Project Purpose

The client is a seasoned strategy consultant working with companies on business transformation, positioning, and growth.  
The portfolio is designed as a **professional showcase** to:

- Present their background and expertise in strategic consulting
- Highlight selected missions and outcomes (while respecting confidentiality)
- Share insights and frameworks developed through experience
- Facilitate professional contact and networking

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

The application is built using:

- **React** with **TypeScript** – for a robust, component-based architecture
- **Tailwind CSS** – to ensure a clean, modern, and responsive UI

## 🧩 Key Features

- **About Section** outlining the manager’s profile and strategic focus
- **Case Studies** presented as anonymized project snapshots
- **Contact Section** with clear CTAs for collaboration or speaking opportunities

## 💼 UX Focus

The UX is tailored for a professional audience: potential clients, partners, or recruiters in executive, board, or consulting roles. The content is intentionally concise, with a focus on clarity, structure, and credibility.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

While the first version is functional, further improvements are planned:

- SEO enhancements for better discoverability
- Integration of blog/articles written by the manager
- Performance and accessibility audits
